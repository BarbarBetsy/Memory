# Memory
A memory game.

Build as the second project in the Udacity Front End Nano-Degree.

## Dependencies
* jQuery
* FontAwesome
* GoogleFonts

## How to play
+ Turn around the cards.
+ Find all matching images.
+ Win.

Depending on your (lack of) progress you lose stars and time. Both are used to calculate your score in the end. If you make it in the top 3 you can put your name in the high score.
You can play it on a desktop computer or on your mobil device.

## How I build it
Slowly and carefully and from scratch.

For the cards I used the illustrations from my childens book *the hedgehog & his architect* drawn by [Tania Sivertsen](https://taniasivertsen.jimdo.com/).
